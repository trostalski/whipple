# Whipple

**This project is under development!**

Whipple is a project that provides introspection into FHIR data. It allows you to explore and analyze FHIR data in a user-friendly way, giving you insight into the structure and content of the data.

## Getting started ([Docker](https://www.docker.com/))

Clone the project into a local directory using:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/trostalski/whipple.git
cd whipple
```

Make sure you have Docker installed and running, then execute the following command in the root directory to spin up all docker containers:

```shell
docker-compose up
```

The interface should now be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
